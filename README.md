## background
Genesis is a desktop application created to support the PhD thesis in Computer Science and Music I completed
at Durham University between 2009-2013. The key focus is Generative AI and Machine Creativity in the context of musical performance and composition.

It leverages Generative Processes including Genetic Algorithms, Fractals, Symbolic AI and Stochasticity to help musicians explore soundscapes in real-time. 

The thesis predates the rapid growth and increased availability of LLMs, so it represents a point in time when Generative AI was accomplished by using 'traditional' algorithmic approaches.

The outcome of Genesis supported the notion I presented in my thesis to propose:

> Generative processes are most successful when we partner as 'human
and machine', creating new and innovative outputs _together_. 

A point of view I still hold to this day, LLMs or not...

You can see the full thesis [here](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11033/).

I share the code here in the hopes that it brings value to the Generative AI community.

## how to
To use Genesis, you will need to download [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), and get an instance
of it running. Then, simply load the Genesis file from this repo and you
should be away.

- I expect that you may need to install some classes that do not come as
  part of the standard SuperCollider install

  - If so, SuperCollider provides comprehensive error messaging which should
    help you identify what's missing

  - Use the guide [here](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/)
    to help installation

- SuperCollider has an incredible
  [community](https://supercollider.github.io/links) which should also
  be able to help with general SuperCollider questions
