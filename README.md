Genesis is the programme created to support the PhD thesis I completed
at Durham University between 2009-2013.

You can see the full thesis [here](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11033/).

Put into its rawest form, Genesis provides an exploratory platform through
which musical performers and composers can transcend soundscapes through
generative processes that can be automated or controlled manually.

The outcome of Genesis supported the notion I presented in the thesis to suggest
that generative processes are most successful when we partner as 'human
and machine', creating new and innovative outputs together.

To use Genesis, you will need to download
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), and get an instance
of it running. Then, simply load the Genesis file from this repo, and you
should be away.

- I expect that you may need to install some classes that do not come as
  part of the standard SuperCollider install

  - If so, SuperCollider provides comprehensive messaging which should
    help you identify what's missing

  - Use the guide [here](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/)
    to help installation

- SuperCollider has an incredible
  [community](https://supercollider.github.io/links) which should also
  be able to help with general SuperCollider questions

I also have a packaged version of the programme which runs on its own
without any need for SuperCollider installation. Feel free to reach out
to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwilliam/) and I am
happy to share.

I hope this brings value to the Generative community.
